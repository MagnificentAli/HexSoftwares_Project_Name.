Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Student Sleep Patterns dataset.

This repository contains an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a synthetically generated dataset that explores the sleep patterns of university students. The analysis is aimed at identifying correlations between sleep duration, sleep quality, and various lifestyle factors, such as study hours, screen time, and physical activity. The dataset provides insights into the relationship between lifestyle choices and sleep quality, which can be valuable for understanding factors that affect student well-being.

Dataset Overview
The dataset contains 500 rows and 14 columns, with each row representing a unique student. The columns represent various attributes of the students, including:

Student_ID: Unique identifier for each student.
Age: The age of the student in years.
Gender: Gender of the student (categorical: 'Male', 'Female', 'Other').
University_Year: The current year of study (categorical: '1st Year', '2nd Year', '3rd Year', '4th Year').
Sleep_Duration: Average hours of sleep per night.
Study_Hours: Average number of hours spent studying per day.
Screen_Time: Average number of hours spent on screens per day (excluding studying).
Caffeine_Intake: Average number of caffeinated beverages consumed per day.
Physical_Activity: Average minutes spent on physical activity per day.
Sleep_Quality: Subjective rating of sleep quality on a scale of 1 to 10 (1 being the worst, 10 being the best).
Weekday_Sleep_Start: Time the student typically goes to sleep on weekdays (in 24-hour format).
Weekend_Sleep_Start: Time the student typically goes to sleep on weekends.
Weekday_Sleep_End: Time the student typically wakes up on weekdays.
Weekend_Sleep_End: Time the student typically wakes up on weekends.
